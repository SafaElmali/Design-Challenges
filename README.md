<h3>Why This Repo Exist? 🤔</h3>

- <p>I realised that I am really bad at writing CSS and making responsive web apps without using libraries (ex. Bootstrap) 😭 <br> So I decided to implement designs from several websies to improve myself (hopefully!)</p>
- <p>I will put each design challenge source codes 💻</p>
- <p>I will deploy each of my challenges to <a href="https://zeit.co/">Zeit</a>. So you can also preview them!</p>
<br>
<p>Feel free to make pull requests to help me to improve my 💩 codes! 🥳 </p>
